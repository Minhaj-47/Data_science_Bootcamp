Heating ,Daniel May 2019 It's a great, huge space with an awesome view. Everything was very clean. Checkin/out is a breeze. Faris August 2022 It was nice Palm August 2022 good place but elevator are not enough Kay August 2022 I haven't given a 2 star review to any business till date, this would be my first one.To start off, during our 5 day stay at the place, no one had come to clean the place during our stay. Upon asking about it, the host said that cleaning was done before checking in already (which by the way is a requirement, not an extra service) I screenshot our entire conversation and sent it to him, and it seems like his English was poor that he didnt even understand what he replied "yes" to. So I tried to ask him for fresh towels, no need for the cleaning as the conversation wasnt going anywhere. He told me fresh towels each time would be 300฿(50฿×6). I went to buy my own towels. At this point, I wasnt feeling good about communicating with him.  And a bigger issue arises. The airconditioner on the master bedroom (which me my husband and 2 young children were sleeping in) started making really loud sounds, I went to sleep out on the sofa hoping the kids wouldnt wake up and hoping that it was just a temporary issue We shut the air in the morning, and went back to sleep without it. (Also, atleast 3 remotes (ac,tv) werent working in the house probably didnt change batteries.)  The next day we were out most of the day and at some point we came back and turn3d on the ac of master for 10 mins, there was no sound so we thought ok maybe it wont happen again. We went out again and came back, got ready to sleep, 15 minutes into turning the ac, the loud sounds came again. This time much louder, and it started leaking near plugpoints. ( It was really loud, not the sound of a minor issue.) so this is 10pm and nobody couldve come fixed the ac at this point. We decided to all sleep on the floor of the living room. ALSO, the master doesnt have a bedroom door, so we were still hearing the loud sounds! The next day (the day of checkout) i messaged the host about it. The cleaner and the building maintenance staff came to see the situation , we spoke in Thai and they asked me, how I managed to sleep here. And The host decided to not reply to my chat or didnt take any responsibility for what had happened. He said it had never happened before and maybe it was just minor? The building staff and maid told me the air needs to be removed and piping needs to be completely redone, so clearly its not a minor issue! He just dismissed my complaint entirely, and hadnt answered my chat. The view was beautiful from the living and thats the only reason for not giving a 1 star review. :( Show more Anh July 2022 Nice house near the ocean Palesa July 2022 This is a lovely property in a great location. ,['Hosted_by_Nutt@1f23e84a-f226-4b5d-9405-ffe291206b13', 'Hosted_by_Nutt@2e531e75-58f8-48a1-817e-f7b1fb38d31a', 'Hosted_by_Nutt@f8fa6b7a-0e11-4d6a-b636-5dd94f49d090', 'Hosted_by_Nutt@f8bd991a-1b55-4bfd-a2c1-024f42617d9f', 'Hosted_by_Nutt@2c9927ec-f4c2-44da-904d-6b2761865f5a']

Check yourself into the home with a door code ,Alissa August 2022 The location was nice and the facility it’s self was nice also. But the cleanliness wasn’t up to par for the price. When we arrived the house keepers were still there cleaning the villa. We were suppose to check in after 3pm which we got there around 4pm hoping everything would’ve been ready to go. There was also left over food in the fridge we had to dispose, the mirrors were dirty, there was suppose old water cup left in one of the bedrooms. But the communication with the hot was great overall. Show more Filipp April 2022 Nice place worth the money. Will definitely go again. A little confusion with the check in but Mod replied fast and everything was resolved. Daniel October 2020 Great place. Very roomy fast wifi plenty of english stations on the tv. Kathleen February 2020 We had power issues on our one night stay, but the house is still nice. Mod sent her maintenance men to rewire the breaker, but we didn't have power until 1am. Hopefully this issue was only a one time problem for them :) Greg January 2020 Mod is a fantastic & very attentive host. Check-in was very easy & the place was fantastic, the livingroom even had a karaoke setup. The location is a little bit away from the major attractions of Pattaya but getting a ride was never difficult. The place is within walking distance of the beach, it is a moderate walk as a heads up. The neighborhood is very quiet & provides a perfect escape/break from the rowdiness of Walking Street. I will definitely book Mod's place again when I return to Pattaya. Show more Pear July 2019 The is gorgeous, clean and cozy. Checking in process was easy and not complicated at all. Mod also gave me enough and helpful information about a way to the house, how to access the house and how things in the house function. Contact her via phone is faster than sending her a message. If you want hang out outside, calling a taxi is the most expensive one, you should either walk a little bit to find a local taxi or call a grab driver or rent a car!

Heating ,Abhay August 2022 great location and awesome setup. Phil July 2022 Great stay, location is fantastic, close to everything and right on the beach, Mae was helpful and welcoming, all great. Chutima July 2022 In a great location. However, the check-in time is more later than other places (3.p.m, and unfortunately our case was another 10 mins late). We expected the cleanliness as the guest needs to pay for the cleaning service for 1,700 THB, but what we found was most of the kitchenwares especially pans were dirty. We had to clean everything before using again. However, the cleanliness of the rooms was ok.  The Aircon in each bedroom are a bit noisy. And the tap in the small room was broken.  Check-out time is 11:00 (again quite earlier than others), but this was a bit more flexible than check-in time.  Host is very nice and quick response. Show more Marie June 2022 Beautiful view from the apartment. Every room has a seaview. Excellent location, at a quieter part compared to the main Pattaya beach, less traffic jam too. There's a night market with plenty of food stalls along the beach just a short 3min walk away. Many nice restaurants n cafe within walking distance too. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the water pressure of the taps in the toilets are very low. Other than that it is an excellent place to stay and the host is very responsive to messages. Highly recommend this place especially for big groups. Show more Hannah June 2022 Loved this space for a family visit! The balcony views are beautiful and the nearby beach is nice and calm. The check-in was a bit awkward but once we figured it out it was fine. There is plenty of living room space and it was very nice to have 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. 주은 May 2022 Everything is wonderful If you wanna make a good memory in Pattaya I recommend this place ,['Hosted_by_Metiya@ab90c0e2-a7f1-4e23-b93e-9379a6f5f883', 'Hosted_by_Metiya@a7dc154b-f3a5-43da-aa1b-f515b22dd54f', 'Hosted_by_Metiya@6af34be5-896a-4451-9564-06a208041e51', 'Hosted_by_Metiya@0698a90f-8fd8-46f3-b666-fb040ae3696e', 'Hosted_by_Metiya@4e5c82b3-e43b-4652-827d-4045128a983a']

Heating ,Sarunsiri January 2022 Great location, well equipped and clean unit. Nice hotel facilities right on the beach. We were there so we practically have all the pools to ourselves. Khun Jarujit is very accomodatinng and kind. We had a great stay. Daniel November 2019 Fantastic, Responsive host, Period. One of Airbnb's biggest challenges will be assuring the consistency of quality of listing, level of service. Not being able to physically inspect each listing opens up exposure for unsuspecting travellers, and the level of responsiveness to issues can also vary greatly from host to host, geographic location to location. I must stay, before coming to Anne's place, I had exactly that kind of experience, twice in Thailand, falling victim for over exaggerated, untruthful representation of accomodation that threatened to ruin my rare and hard earned 2 month sabbatical in S.E. Asia. So I was so relieved when I entered Anne's beach side condo, full of anxiety, anticipation, praying it wasn't going to be another disaster, with a sigh of relief. Anne was so responsive, from the beginning of check-in to check-out. We had a few issues to work out in between, but it is to be expected, for a long term stay, to settle in. A few great features to note, that I enjoyed a lot, and the main reason for choosing, is that this condo is beach side. So it means you don't have to go very far to get to the beach, it's right there, with your own fenced off beach front. The entire Modus Complex is half Hotel, and half Private Condo, sharing facilities of restaurants, bars and other amenities. This condo also has a very nice bed, great quality mattress,and that is so so important to get good rest. It also has a large bath tub for two, if you like to soak in relaxation. Large Samsung smart TV to do what you need. The only down side was the Internet, being an older facility, Internet tops out at 5-6 Mps, but even with VPN into the United States, I still managed to make it work, albeit some frustration at times. But we're supposed to be on vacation anyway, so it wasn't a huge issue. The one thing I have to say, is that Anne was very responsive, and an attentive host, taking care of issues whatever, whenever they came up. You will definitely not be disappointed. I had a great 40 days there, and fond memories of an eye candy ocean view very morning from the sofa, and lounge chair on the balcony. Show more Pamela August 2019 Omg! This place was amazing, beachfront view and walking distance to a private beach. Anne was great at answering all my questions. The ones she didn’t know, she would find out and got back at me on a promptly manner. When I first booked this place, I had to give a small description as to why I wanted to stay there. Basically, I told her that I was turning 50 this year, and I was celebrating it on a Thailand trip.  To my surprise, she had left a beautiful welcoming birthday gift on my bed with such a warming note. This was so special.  Furthermore, this place has everything that you are looking for in your own place, cups, plates, utensils, coffee maker, tea kettle, toaster, pots and pans.  This place was impeccably clean, AC was great, tv has some English channels mostly news, WiFi was fast, the view from the balcony was amazing, the modern chic interior decor was also great. There’s nothing that I can say was bad.   As a guest there, you can use the hotel gym located next to the Airbnb. As a side note, the beachfront location is great, but bear in mind that is located about 20 minutes away from the bus terminal. A taxi will run you about 200THB each way. If you are planning to stay there, in seclusion like I intended, make sure that you bring some food and water with you.  Otherwise, the hotel offers a free shuttle to the main road, I didn’t use it because I wanted to relax on the beach. Also, there’s a restaurant in the hotel with much higher prices than you would pay outside, but worth it if you want to do nothing.  There’s also a massage spot near the pool.  Overall, I wished I had stayed longer, but just like everything else, it comes to an end. I would definitely come back. Show more Molly & Kelley April 2019 Anne's place was perfect for our needs as a traveling family. The apartment was super clean and nice, and there was so much storage--which was unexpected but very important as we had a lot of stuff with us in transition. The apartment has a very clever design and every wall is a cabinet and every mirror is a cupboard. It has everything you need with a full kitchen (no oven, but you don't usually find that in Thailand.) It did have a stove, microwave, toaster and coffee maker (added by host as per my request!) We did most of our cooking in the apartment as we found the resort restaurants to be over priced and not great. We had our own car so we were able to get places easily to go shopping and to restaurants. The location is a bit isolated which we enjoyed. The private beach is nice we really enjoyed the pools. One note is that this listing says it has a hot tub, which it does not. It may be a mistranslation. There is bath tub with hot running water in apartment and the resort has a bubbling pool next to bar but it is cold water. The gym is nice and air conditioned in a closed room in resort, not on the beach like some pics on trip advisor.  Our kids loved the place--whenever I go into a new place I look for hazards/child-proofing. No worries there, the design and decor is so simple there is nothing for kids to get into. The doors, cupboards, and cabinets have a space that makes it hard to slam your fingers in it, which I appreciated. The sofa bed where the kids slept in the living room was very comfortable and there are black out curtains to keep the light out. They enjoyed the play room and the baby pool, and have a hot bath in the tub each night! The beach playground is also fun.  Overall, 5 stars for this place and our needs. We went to many play areas around for the kids at Terminal 21, Big C/Central Marina, and of course Harbor Land. This town is unexpectedly a kid's paradise! We didn't see any of the night life, but that is okay. We were just looking for a place to get away and relax on a budget and this was perfect!  Anne's hospitality was above and beyond! She always replied right away and had staff at the resort to come address any issues. Thank you, Anne! Show more Molly & Kelley April 2019 Great place inside a resort that has wonderful amenities. It is actually on the beach, unlike the other Airbnb’s advertised with pictures of this same beach! (I saw many tourists walking from other resorts along dusty road in swimwear to get to our beach!) This one room apartment has a very clever use of space—every wall is a cabinet and every mirror is a cupboard. This was helpful because we were traveling with two kids and a lot of stuff. There was so much storage! The decorations are minimal and stylish and it is basically child proof because the art is hung high on walls and there are not breakable things sitting around, which I appreciate! We loved the big soft bed (if you have stayed in Thailand you know some mattresses are very hard!) and the living room sofa bed was also very comfortable. The big bathtub in the bathroom was a great amenity. One note that although this resort has 3 pools, beach, restaurants, and gym, there is NO hot tub like this listing says. It is a bubbling cold pool at the bar which is very refreshing and delightful. Kids playground on beach is nice but annoyingly the resort has put the smoking area right next to it. The beach is very rocky but lots of cool shells and sea glass to be found. We visited the Sanctuary of Truth next door and recommend buying tickets online at Klook to save money. The pad Thai at resort restaurant is very good with lots of vegetables added in. The playroom inside resort is small but will keep kids busy for a bit.  Anne and her staff are wonderful! We did a long term stay so cleaner came once per week (included in price) and made the place sparkling clean! No laundry on premises but a great lady down the road near taco stand who will wash and dry and press for a very good price.  Anne was very kind and when my kids were sick and we couldn’t take a planned trip to Koh Samet, she let us extend our stay at a discount. We did go to Koh Samet in the end and it had the most beautiful beaches, like nothing you can find in Pattaya.  Overall great service and great place to stay with kids. We may be back! Show more Mario August 2022 Very accommodating host. Property has a nice view of the ocean and the beach is very close. You will need transportation or Bolt/Grab accounts though as it is not really in a walkable neighborhood. The Sanctuary of Truth is within walking distance though. ,['Hosted_by_Jarujit@ee6852ad-4d4a-4d8e-bb9a-852b18ec878b', 'Hosted_by_Jarujit@09ac03e2-5135-4af2-8fde-b8646d25eaa1', 'Hosted_by_Jarujit@d3c3d7d7-a42d-4b86-80fb-5a7c88cebacf', 'Hosted_by_Jarujit@b50284c8-ffbe-4643-8efe-be55028410ba', 'Hosted_by_Jarujit@ed9615fa-91b5-426f-ae49-7cb267b690a1']

9 ,Internet-famous The base Building A, 22nd floor, front sea view, 2 bedrooms, 1 living room, rooftop infinity pool, downtown, near Hilton. ,4.68 · ,50 reviews ,$59 ,Chon Buri, Thailand ,About this space
The host also has an internet-famous apartment in Bangkok. If you need to click the following link, the twin cities are linked, and the discount is more ~
https://abnb.me/d3XpRQeCEZ
- If this room's date is not available, please click on my profile picture, it's both the front high floor sea view and two rooms and one living room in Building A.
- This room is a two bedroom one hall on the 22nd floor of the Base A building. It is the best room type in more than 1,400 Base rooms. There is no one. It has a super large front sea view with a great sunset view of Ko Lan Island and the whole city of South Pattaya. This floor has an impeccable view.
-Three beds in the room, King SIze in the master bedroom, Queen size in the 2nd bedroom, and Single in the living room
- I can help book airport transfer, day trip, Pattaya store
- One-to-one service to protect you on your holiday in Thailand
The superiority of the Base is reflected in 3 aspects, starting with its most famous infinity pool, which is located on the 31st floor, overlooking the sea of Pattaya, it is one of Pattaya's hot spots.
- The second is its superb location in the heart of Pattaya's core area, 5 minutes walk to Central Festival, the biggest mall in Pattaya, no more than 5km from the walking street or Shemale/Adult Show to the Temple of Truth, 24-hour Songthaew in front of the door, 7-11 downstairs, etc.
- Thirdly, the neighborhood is very well equipped, 2 swimming pools, 1 gym, 1 basketball court
The space
※ Two bedrooms and one living room are fewer in Base. This room is located on the 22nd floor. There are 2 bedrooms, both with queen beds. There is also a sofa in the living room that can be used for extra guests to rest. Both balconies and living rooms are larger.
※ Why choose Base as your residence in Pattaya - convenient transportation Base is located in the heart of Pattaya's core area, 300m from the beach, 500m from Central Festival, and 1.2km from Walking Street in the red light district. About 3 kilometers from the bus station, about 15 minutes from the apartment by Song Taew - not only is the hardware facility Base as the representative of high-end apartments in Pattaya in an outstanding location, but the community facilities are all available for tenants as free resources. The infinity swimming pool on the 31st floor of Building A, the sea view lounge on the 27th floor of Building B, the gymnasium, the children's playroom, the gymnasium, and the basketball court in Building C.
※ What makes this house different from other houses? -- The hygienic sheets and duvet covers in the room ensure that every guest is changed, and the interior of the room is kept clean and tidy.Some relatives feel that the cleaning fee is relatively high. In order to ensure that the sheets are clean, we get the laundry cleaned and disinfected every time. The cleaning fee is about 180 baht per time. In addition, the cleaning fee for aunts is higher than for others because it is for cleaning. So the cleaning fee for our house will be slightly higher. - Location is on the outside of the 22nd floor of Building A, you can see the sea view, and it is convenient to go to the infinity pool on the 31st floor. The room is the best room type in the whole base
※ As your private online guide, the service provides you with instant transportation guide, all tips for eating, drinking and enjoying, escort for your first trip to Pattaya, detailed tips, and VX consultation.

Heating ,Saptarshi September 2022 Great stay Ritabrata August 2022 Excellent stay. I have been to Puri many times before, but this might be one of the best experience me and my family ever had. The property offered top notch amenities and it was very clean during our 3.5 days of stay.But caretaker Sunil probably the single biggest USP of this stay. The way he cooked helped and supported us in every needs, hats off to him. Surly will visit again 🤟🏻 Show more Asmita August 2022 Great stay!!! Sunil, the caretaker of the property is an absolute gem whose behaviour, attentiveness and masterful cooking skills is going to win everyone's hearts. The location is very close to the station and though located in a quiet and secluded area devoid of the hustle bustle, it is well connected to the main points of the town. Though the model beach is mostly highlighted in the property description, the blue flag beach is closer than that and definitely cleaner. The rooms are spacious, clean and well taken care of with the promised amenities. Perfect for families who want to relax, visit the ocean and have great food... Show more Manoj August 2022 Great Stay!  Thanks to Sunil specially, he was very supportive and guided us well for Puri Darshan and other places during our stay.  I must appreciate his cooking skills and I recommend everyone to have his food during your.  Location of the house is awesome and beach is just 10 min walking. Also you get easily cabs and Autos nearby.  Great experience overall Show more Bijoy August 2022 The stay was excellent. The communication was clear from the time of booking. The place itself was spacious with all facilities. It takes about Rs 100 in auto to reach the main beach and shopping center. There is also a beach about 5-10 minutes walk which is very beautiful. Finally coming to Sunil the caretaker he was the best caretaker we have ever seen. His food was tasty but the best part was he went out of his way to make sure all our needs were met. He was always available and took excellent care. We enjoyed the stay and will definitely come back. Show more Surajit July 2022 we are very grateful to owner Mr. Naidu and caretaker sunil for the lovely experience. They are always ready to help you.

Heating ,Andy September 2019 Awesome Rodner May 2019 Beautiful and clean. I really love it Chattawat August 2022 Nice location, big swimming pools, great place to stay. Enfant August 2022 Highly recommended Clement July 2022 Great place, a bit old but good value Jim July 2022 Great value. Good view. Amazing pool. Its a very big room with an gigantic bathroom including a big jacuzzi. It has 2 sofas for sleeping besides the double bed so up to 5-6 people can sleep here. The place got an awesome pool and friendly security staff. Nicha answers quick and helpful. Also she allowed early checkin and late checkout. The only thing that was a problem was the noise from the hotel being build next to this building. Its construction of a big condominium building.

Heating ,Betsy December 2019 There aren’t that many beds. There is a sofa in each room which can be adjusted to lay flat, can fit 2 small people. But the sofas are leather material, not the most comfy to sleep on without bedsheets. Make sure to ask for bed sheets beforehand. WiFi signal was a bit weak. Other than that, cute spot, great for the heat with the super cool pool, which is not that deep. My family enjoyed this home. I suggest getting solid directions before trying to find this place if you are not familiar with the streets in Thailand. Host responds very quickly. Show more Zaid July 2022 I booked the property for 16 people that included women and children, basically families. When we reached the property, there was no one we can contact. There was no office and no single person that could help us guide. We were roaming around all the area looking for our villa and people to ask, to help us check in. Not that I never messaged the host, i texted him after booking got confirmed and i also texted him 3 hours before checking in, he did not reply. On the spot when there was no help, i contacted airbnb support and from out of the blue the host messages me saying 'i am sorry, i cant check in'. The situation was terrible. We had wasted 4 hours already. Then we had to spend the whole night looking for a place to stay. Our holiday was for 3 days and we wasted one complete day on finding a place to stay. It was evening and then night, as time was passing it was getting more difficult to find a place. We are all working people and students here, our time is precious. The host was so irresponsible with us. Simply saying 'sorry' was so easy for him. And now we have to wait for another 15 working days to get our refund. Crazy Show more Matuporn July 2020 This place is okay. There are a lot of spaces and bedrooms. However, it’s a bit older than I expected. The water is not running at night.

Heating ,Jeffrey June 2022 Unique property with peaceful setting Ck December 2021 Awesome place for family! We had 4Days 3Nights at this place. My niece love pool while my parents love beach deck. Clean and nice house with stunning view and quiet beach. Christina was so responsive and helpful! Dennis March 2019 Great private house. Very private and quiet Stephen May 2017 An amazing view and perfect if you want to get away to a remote area away from the main tourist areas of Thailand. We really enjoyed our stay. The help arranging a personal chef and daily massages made it even better. Highly recommend Devereaux May 2016 This house is fantastic! What a wonderful escape from Bangkok. Photos are an accurate description and communication was very helpful. This is a sleepy fishing village with a few Thai style resorts. This house is the most gorgeous on the beach. It is very well-equipped (bring a can opener!) and comfortable. It is even more spacious than advertised. The guard is so very helpful and discrete. We truly enjoyed our stay and wish we could go back again next weekend. Show more Ben April 2016 From the living room and back yard, you get the spectacular million-dollar view of the Chao Sam Ran beach to yourself. The beach, while well-known to local, is still relatively unknown to tourists, so it is very quiet, and almost empty, with fine sand and clear water. The house is nicely decorated, clean and simple. The roof deck terrace is definitely a surprise icing on the cake. Had Chao Sam Ran is a small village, yet it is only 20 minutes from the Phetburi town center, 45 minutes from Hua Hin and 2hr from Bangkok. Alexandra and Christina communicate very well, makes it very easy for us to check in and get settled. Highly recommended!

Location is perfect and the building has a very nice gym, pool and views of the city Tessa August 2022 Unfortunately the rooftop pool was closed. As we only stayed for one night it didn't affect our stay much. The room wasn't the cleanest but then again, the cost was very little. Overall we had a good experience. Bryan July 2022 Perfect location with good security.  Unfortunately the apartment does not seem to be maintained well as a few things did not work.

The condo unit was as advertised & I enjoyed my stay. Charles January 2022 Sam is the best host in many years of using Airbnb. The room was exactly as described. I didn’t have any issues but Sam contacted me mid stay to see if I needed anything. That was a nice touch. The room is on the smaller side but really good for me. The condo unit was clean and modern with the best rooftop infinity pool in central Pattaya. I wouldn’t hesitate to rent from Sam again. Highly recommend this unit.

Heating ,Drew March 2020 Fantastic hospitality by the host and phenomenal location! Strongly recommend to anyone who wants to relax and have a 5 star experience! I look forward to coming back and renting again! Al January 2020 Regis’ condo was everything he promised and more. It truly is located in a fine location, adjacent to endless, empty and spotlessly clean beaches. The two of us found his condo large and well appointed. The TrueVision television package was a nice surprise. We drove down to Hua Hin and did not drive again until it was time to leave. There is a grocery store directly across the street, as well as a 7/11 and endless places to eat. There is a larger shopping mall just down the street. In addition, I brought my road bicycle and met with a huge group of local riders who ride together several times a week. 100 kilometer bike rides generated a good night’s sleep. We also explored much that Hua Hin has to offer. We both would highly recommend Hua Hin and a stay at Regis’ condominium. Show more Kenneth July 2019 Great location Astrid February 2018 The apartment in a condo directly at the beachfront of Hua Hin was the perfect location for our stay. It is quiet but close to the centre and has a nice pool . There are many shops, night markets and restaurants nearby which can be reached within a short footwalk or a short drive with a Tuktuk. Also enjoyed the walks along the beach, with plenty of bars for a short rest. Our host Regis was friendly and helpful and has made many proposals for activities nearby. We fully enjoyed our stay and would always consider this apartment as accommodation for our next stay in Hua Hin. Show more Charles July 2022 We stayed in Regis's apartment for a week and the only problem with it was it wasn't longer. The apartment is fresh and clean with a great layout, nice view, and is in a great location with direct access onto the beach. The gardens and swimming pool are beautiful, walking distance to town, night market and shopping centre with public transport on the doorstep when we wanted to travel further. Communication with Regis was prompt and clear. We would definitely stay at Regis's apartment again. Great host and highly recommended. Show more Troy July 2022 A very spacious, clean and incredibly well located apartment. The apartment is definitely appropriate for a family in terms of size and amenities, and is located on the best part of the beach and a short walk to shops, restaurants, town and sights. The grounds are very picturesque and the beach front pool is one of the best in Hua Hin.

Heating ,Ben March 2022 Definitely worth the money. Roof top pool has gorgeous view. Responsive host. Alex October 2019 Amazing location and very cool building! Recommended Mathias August 2022 Realt Nice place Naman August 2022 Go for this apartment if you are looking to get scammed by the glamorised photos of the rooftop swimming pool.  The host hid the fact from us that the pool is non-functional and used the photos as a bait to lure not just us, but many more guests.  Nothing in the apartment was worthy of the price that we paid for it, only to leave disappointed with my family. The only decent thing was the views from the balcony and master bedroom.  Outside apartment door stinks of seafood (maybe there's a cold storage nearby). It was barely clean and hygienic, hair of the previous guests could be found on the bathroom floor.  Last but not the least, the second room is barely big enough to accommodate only a damn bed, let alone your luggage or anything else.  Conclusively, if you're opting for this place solely because of the steamy hot rooftop infinity pool photos, don't! Show more 이 August 2022 good!!!!!!!! Benjamin August 2022 The host is lying because there was no swimming pool even if the announcement said they were 2 including one on the rooftop. In addition to that he kept coming into our apartment. To conclude it’s forbidden to rent on Airbnb in this residence so the host is doing it illegally. You shouldn’t take this apartment.

Not included ,Andrew December 2021 Place was exactly as advertised. Host was very communicative. I stayed here for 10 days late December 2021. It is a very quiet complex, and close walking distance to the beach, and many great restaurants, and 7-eleven. Unit was very clean. The beach closest has a huge protected swimming area, it’s a great beach with lots of tree. Fantastic. Walking down the beach further (couple blocks) you will find jet ski rental, kayak rental, and wind surfing lessons/rental.

Heating ,Igor December 2021 Million dollar views!  This is one of the best apartments we stayed in Thailand. The apartment Penthouse proportions with a modern and tastefully decorated interior. The sea views from the massive balcony were the highlight and one of the only ones I recall where I could view both sunrise and sunset!  Peter greeted us on arrival and explained the essentials. He lives nearby and was responsive to our needs and questions. His suggestions for nearby restaurants were spot on.  The apartment was well appointed and had all the essentials one needed.  The property has a lovely pool and garden area and a great semi-private beach. The sea is great and clean in dry season.  We hope to return soon!!

Definitely recommend Silver October 2018 Location is good. Stay is good. And they got super duper nice view swimming pool. Yerby July 2018 Want me to tell the truth? I think the house is very good, very clean, the environment is very good, but the landlord responded very slowly, not even replying. I think this needs improvement. After all, we are not locals. Many routes and problems need consultation. If the landlord does not give a reply, we are really difficult.

39 ,The Base Seaview Big Balcony Top Floor Infinity Pool Pattaya Core ,4.70 · ,30 reviews ,$33 ,Muang Pattaya, Chang Wat Chon Buri, Thailand ,About this space
For stays of 2 days or more, remember to add me to WeChat to get the discount coupon before booking, you can get 199 off!!~
(None during the pandemic)

I can help book airport transfer, day trip, Pattaya store, cheaper than Taobao.

 This is a large balcony room on the 21st floor of Building A, only about 6% of the entire Base is this large one room type. You can see the entire Pattaya city night view to the south, and also see the sea front, the sunset of Grand Island.The biggest and best room type in one room.

In addition, the host has 2 rooms on the 21st floor, so it is more convenient to stay on the first floor if everyone books.

The house has always been self-contained and has never been rented out. The decoration is very new and relatively cherished, so I hope to be cared for by everyone.

The Base Central Pattaya, located in the heart of Pattaya city, cross the road to Central Festival and Hilton Hotel, the biggest shopping mall in Pattaya.Pattaya Beach is 300 meters across the street and the famous Walking Street (red light district) is 10 minutes away.
30 meters downstairs there are 7-11 and Family, 20 meters there is major healthcare, 300 meters inward to Pattaya's second largest Agogo bar street. It is more grounded than the walking street filled with Chinese tour groups at happy Hours.
The space
※ Why choose Base as your residence in Pattaya - convenient transportation Base is located in the heart of Pattaya's core area, 300m from the beach, 500m from Central Festival, and 1.2km from Walking Street in the red light district. About 3 kilometers from the bus station, about 15 minutes from the apartment by Song Taew - not only is the hardware facility Base as the representative of high-end apartments in Pattaya in an outstanding location, but the community facilities are all available for tenants as free resources. The infinity swimming pool on the 31st floor of Building A, the sea view lounge on the 27th floor of Building B, the gymnasium, the children's playroom, the gymnasium, and the basketball court in Building C. ※ What makes this house different from other houses? -- The hygienic sheets and duvet covers in the room ensure that every guest is changed, and the interior of the room is kept clean and tidy.Some relatives feel that the cleaning fee is relatively high. In order to ensure that the sheets are clean, we take them to the laundry shop for cleaning and disinfection every time. The cleaning fee is about 180 baht per time. In addition, the cleaning fee for aunty is higher than other people's, so the cleaning fee for our house is slightly higher - the location is convenient to go to the infinity pool on the 31st floor. You can see the sea view, the room is close to the inside of the building, and there is no interference from the neighboring bar as well. -- As your private online guide, the service provides you with instant transportation guide and all tips for eating, drinking and playing, and provides you with a personal escort for your first trip to Pattaya.

The space
**Random room arrangement **
I have many rooms in this apartment, one bedroom & two bedroom Different floors, different rooms, different view, so the price is not the same. Please tell me which floor or type of room you want. The picture shows only one of the rooms
~~
1) Two persons sleep inside the bedroom on the queen sized bed.
2) 3rd person sleeps on the sofa
3) 4th person sleeps on the foldable floor mattress.

My condominium is economically and reasonably charged for just 2 persons. I do not charge extra for the 3rd and 4th persons to stay in my apartment. I even provide extra pillows and blankets for the 3rd and 4th persons. Basically, 3 - 4 persons stay for the price of 2 persons. Towels for the 3rd and 4th persons are chargeable at 50 baht per piece. I appreciate your understanding.

The condominium is about 30 square meters in size. It has 1 bedroom with 1 queen sized bed, 1 living room, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen and 1 balcony.

So, please be understandable if 4 of you find the condominium is a bit too tight. Sometimes it's fun to be so close together.

Thanks.

Security cameras on property ,Anthony August 2022 With the exception of the owner which I would avoid at any cost--more on this later-- the place is in a perfect location, near the center of the town. The condo is small but ok. Some cockroaches but that happens in warm/humid places. My only issue is with the owner. Poor communication. Lies to you. I requested late check out at 2pm instead of 12pm. She agreed but on the day of the check out she changed her mind, because she had "another" guest checking in. I looked on airbnb and the condo was NOT blocked and available for booking. Then she said if i wanted to stay until 2pm I would have to book for another day and she would "cancel" the other customer...very sketchy, simply lying. Also she wanted to charge me for water but presented to me the previous month's water bill, not the month I stayed at the condo. Frustrated with her. I would avoid this host at any cost. Show more 재철 (Jin) July 2022 It was very clean and clean. The location of the accommodation was good, the view was good, and I had a good stay without any inconvenience. ,['Hosted_by_Kanokwan@70861e2c-e901-469d-936e-e4e661157ca8', 'Hosted_by_Kanokwan@79c459c3-59f9-491c-9733-8acd9d1a57bc', 'Hosted_by_Kanokwan@bff80186-27ef-41cd-8b1b-53c674144eab', 'Hosted_by_Kanokwan@930a4147-56e1-4ee0-b5e8-a7c6694a65fb', 'Hosted_by_Kanokwan@2693c36b-b643-4b7a-9201-2f7cad7d48f6']

The place is clean and tidy. Will definitely stay at the same place during the next visit! 金 August 2022 very nice！The owner is also very considerate！ Guillaume July 2022 Perfect place to stay in Pattaya, really good view, really good location, The host is really nice Sergey June 2022 Unfortunately my stay at that beautiful room was very short due to my urgent job issues. But I definitely will come back here in the nearest future. An exceptional location as everything is on walking distance at the heart of Pattaya city close to the beach road. There are a lot of restaurants and shopping around. Great room amenities. The place was exceptionally clean and has almost everything you need. Gorgeous sunrises and sunset views from the roof tops. Nice ocean and town views from both balconies. Decent gym and few nice pools including infinity pool on the rooftop of building A. Platoo as a hostess is a very friendly and easy to communicate person, giving swift response to all requests. She can also advise some tips and tricks on surrounding facilities but you also have to read thoroughly the preliminary info sent by her. Superb! Will dream about my soonest return for longer stay!

Heating ,Kail August 2022 very nice stay Edward August 2022 Good value room. We stayed for a few nights, and enjoyed the facilities, including the pool room, ping pong table and serenity pool. Very well located for night life. SeungChan August 2022 Good quality, good location , good facility condo. Massage shops and restaurants around. Close to everything. Richard August 2022 Amazing location! Close to everything, but just far enough away to cut down on the noise. Benzi was very prompt and patient with me during the check in process. Everything was outlined in his listing, but I neglected to read thoroughly (my fault). He was accommodating with any questions I had. 24 hour security is a nice touch. They are very courteous and make the condos feel secure. Would choose Benzi and his property during future visits.

Heating ,Andrew September 2022 spacious, fantastic room, in one of the best parts of pattaya beach to live in. Bogdan August 2022 Felt like home, far away from home. Harvinder July 2022 Very good ❤️❤️👍👍 Rodrigo June 2022 Big studio, the AC works perfectly. The only small complaint is you have to pay for the electricity used at the end. At the time of reservation I didn't notice if it was written. It's logic you pay for what you use, but the price obviously is a bit higher than the ad. I recommend coming to this apartment Show more Andreas June 2022 Very good central location, 2 minutes walk to the beach, 10 minutes walk to Walking Street, 5 minutes walk to Central Festival and still very quiet at night.

Heating ,Mandy December 2016 The communication with host was excellent , very quick and wanted to make sure that we had everything that we needed. The condo was clean and ready to go. The view from the balcony onto the pool area was very pleasant and nice. We utilized the pool close to the ocean the most , it was great having the breeze coming in and listening to the waves. The kitchen is stocked for doing light cooking , we utilized mostly for breakfast.  We had 5 adults in our party and it was tight, the one bedroom with attached bath is great , you can see from the pictures that the 2nd bedroom has a sliding glass wall that separates it with the 2nd bath off of the main area as a shared with anyone on the couch. The couch with the extra mattresses is tough as a bed.  The area is very quiet and dark which was fantastic, the trip to town is closer to 15 -20 minutes in my opinion and would be better if we had a car rather then waiting on taxi and paying 300 baht each way.  The previous reviews are correct on the beach , it really needs to be low tide for being able to walk on it , the waves come up to the retaining wall and its not a sitting at stretch of beach type , we stayed at the lovely pool most of the time.  Overall very nice stay, we should have picked a 3rd bedroom condo for our comfort. Show more Erik December 2015 We enjoyed our stay. Khun Nitcharee was quite quick to respond to both our initial booking request and subsequent communications and requests. The condo was exactly as it appears in the photos and comfortably accommodated our party of six adults (plus one child). The wifi, air-conditioning, hot water, etc. all works well. The complex is surrounded by pools, and has an especially beautiful infinity pool and garden overlooking the ocean (which was quite useful because during our stay the tide was usually all the way up against the sea-wall along this section of the shore). Show more Yutthana May 2022 We have stayed at this place three times in 3 years, it is still excellent place and support from host which is quite flexible and provide very good support. Sakol December 2019 Thank you for hosting us and our little dog. We truly enjoyed our stay. It had everything we need. The apartment was spacious and fully equipped. The location is secluded and we love it. Highly recommended! Sato November 2019 Nitcharee is very quick and excellent supporter. She gave us all help and information we need on time exactly. The accommodation is clean and very comfortable. I highly recommend someone who would like to stay with small kids or even dogs. I am sure I will stay here once again. Athigun August 2019 Good value place.

Heating ,Hyang Sook August 2022 good Jasmine August 2022 We had a great time at this place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located. Would absolutely recommend to stay there. ( ¨̮ ) Yu September 2022 Okay, okay. عبدالله August 2022 Excellent location and clean apartment but I had a threshold that didn't allow me to delay check out to 1 hour 승민 August 2022 The location is good and the view from the living room is good! I recommend it 黎 July 2022 The location is very convenient, but to adapt to the sound of the pub outside the street, you won't usually hear it after a little bit.  The house is big and tidy, but the cleanliness is only 7/10.  The person in charge was very responsive and it was something to appreciate.  The windows in the room are leaking and may be aging.  The sofa and bed are comfortable, but one of the rooms can only fit a single bed, so if you are a family of four, you may have to sleep on the couch or on the floor.

Heating ,Levi August 2022 The building is so luxurious with multiple swimming pool. We were able to relax and enjoy ourselves with ease. Dhyey August 2022 A cosy and beautiful condo. View of sea is even better than shown in photos. Building offers rooftop pool and lounge at 42 floor with 360 view of city and sea which is worth your time. Apple was very prompt in responding to our queries. We liked the place and condo so much that we extended our stay in the same place. Show more Shane August 2022 Everything from top to bottom was a wonderful experience. The room was really comfortable and quite cute. The location was excellent - one block from the beach. There were so many great restaurants in very close proximity to the building - one in particular, on the same street about a five minute walk down the road - an excellent steak house. The building itself was outstanding. Just amazing facilities that provided fun filled adventures while exploring the premises. The design team who created the Riviera was very creative and injected a real artistic flair throughout. The gym was exceptional. The lobby was wild even the parking lot was very fun with quotes at each parking stall in Different Colours. But the creme de la crème of the Riviera was the garden (check it out at night) as it was a possessed not only a great vibe but was gorgeously vibrant. Truly beautiful. Shout out to Apple and Emily as both were amazing and very helpful throughout the whole stay. Thanks so much u too. Really appreciate everything. Will be back ! 🍀😜✨ Show more Manohar July 2022 Just one word...Excellent place to stay and host is very helpful and very quick response.... when ever I visit pattaya without any doubt I will connect with Apple....  without any doubt you can book...

※为什么选择Base作为在芭提雅Pattaya的居所
-- 交通便利
Base位于芭提雅核心区的中心地带,距离海滩300M,最大的商场Central Festival 尚泰500M,红灯区步行街Walking Street 1.2KM。
离大巴车站大约3公里,宋条车来公寓大约15分钟左右

-- 硬件设施
Base作为芭提雅高档公寓的代表,不仅位置出众,小区设施一应俱全
A栋31楼的无边泳池,B栋27楼海景休息室,健身房,儿童游乐室,体操房,C栋的篮球场都是作为免费资源对租客开放。

※房东的这件房子和其他有什么与众不同?

-- 客房卫生
床单被套确保每客一换,房间内部保证整洁干净。有些亲觉得清洁费用比较高,是这样的,为了保证床单干净我们每次都拿到洗衣店清洗和消毒,每次清理费用就在180泰铢左右 ,再加上给到阿姨打扫清洁的费用比别人的高就是为了打扫的更加清洁和干净,所以我们家的清理费用会稍微高点

-- 位置
方便去31楼的无边泳池,可以看到海景，房间靠大楼的内侧,没有外侧那样受到周边酒吧动次答次的干扰。

-- 服务
作为您的私人在线导游,为您提供即时的向导交通吃喝玩乐一切攻略,为第一次来芭提雅旅行的您保驾护航,(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)手机基本都在线。

Not included ,Douglas August 2022 Centrally located condo in the middle of Pattaya near Central Mall and one street up from the beach. The Condo has excellent views and great price for the area. The furnishings could use some updating but again the price is really good! Glenn April 2022 The Base is a great location to be in central pattaya. Mr. Yun made the check-in process very easy also if I had any issues he was quick to resolve them. Nice view, nice room. Lon May 2020 Great location, basic place with a very nice and responsive host. Trip was last minute and with curfew I had very little time. Booked on my phone and 15 minutes later Yun was there with my key! Had an issue with the shower, but Yun, who lives in the building, responded within 15 minutes and was in the room within 20. With many places in Thailand having lame AC, worth nothing that both AC units work great and cool the place very quickly. Show more Shivam August 2022 excellent location apartment good for value Henny August 2022 We love Yun’s place. It's peaceful and many places are within walking distance. Bolt and Grab are there if you want to go anywhere further.  Yun is a great host and always responds to all of our queries promptly.  We will definitely stay there again if we go back to Pattaya. Show more Oli July 2022 The accommodation was as described and easy to find. Check in was very quick and straightforward. For the price would recommend to anyone staying in Pattaya for a few nights. ,['Hosted_by_Yun@2673b41c-e7b9-418a-a847-0208325e32c6', 'Hosted_by_Yun@7e145992-c2ea-4195-b225-cae7a2d5b892', 'Hosted_by_Yun@467284e0-371e-4066-b6bc-0cbed1dd974b', 'Hosted_by_Yun@983f9bd1-43b1-47e8-8c19-87ba7900abc1', 'Hosted_by_Yun@7acbf2ed-d029-4d82-a5c5-ddebfcc7f220']

The apartment is very neglected, the furniture is old and has lots of use, the apartment was dirty with sticky floors, sticky surfaces and a dirty smelly refrigerator.

Heating ,Rookun August 2022 It's been a really nice stay in the base for the whole month. Close to the central festival and near lots of shops. The house keeper is friendly, if you need new beddings just ask them and they will come to change for the new beds for you. Bad thing about it is the wifi is slow that's all. Overall the condo room is great. Will definitely be back. Thank you Show more Zakhar June 2022 Cons: - Wi-Fi is really low speed, sometimes you can’t even watch YouTube on 1 device. Mobile internet(operator “true”) has bad connection on this floor as well. So if you need internet - choose the different apartment. - No cleaning. It was promised in description when we booked as weekly cleaning, but when we asked about it - owner told us that it’s not actual and we can take it by ourselves.  Pros: - wonderful view - location - enough kitchen stuff - pool and coworking are nice options - good air conditioners Show more Stuart April 2022 This 2 bedroom had the best views of any condo I have stayed during my many visits to Pattaya. The living area was more than big enough for a family and all rooms had AC which was amazing.  For me, the only downside to this condo was the Internet. As someone who uses a computer a lot the Internet speed was shockingly bad andwhen asked if they were able to provide a quicker speed I was advised no. After staying in the condo I would recommend if Internet speed is important then maybe bring a 5g router or even the host could provide one rather than the slow 4g they have.  Internet aside, this condo was great. The location is second to none but was still quiet every night so sleep was no issue.  I would 100% stay again but would bring a better Internet solution over what the host provided. Show more Sumin January 2020 Good stay ! Seigo November 2019 Place was great so I used Erin's place 2times already.

Heating ,Patsara April 2022 The building was great short distance to the beach with property walkway but in room cleanness was not so impressive. Closet was hanged with a cloth of an unknown person, open bottle of cola was left in the fridge, and scattered dark spot on bedding and sofa. Maids should have cleaned those up before our arrival.  Apart from that host was easy to contact. Show more Dan December 2019 The condo was quite clean, welcoming and having plenty of cold bottled water was really refreshing. There was some coffee and tea for us to drink. As you must know the room is conveniently close to the elevator and not too high, so you don't have to spend lots of time in the elevator. The garbage room was also close by. The two air conditioners were nice and cool. Having the drying rack came in super handy. The swimming pools were wondering! Show more Jira September 2019 Great accommodation. Nice and clean. The pool on 12th floor is very breathtaking and it's located in the same building. To go to the beachfront pool you can either walk or ask for complimentary buggy to pick you up. There is a construction going on and will probably continue for months. However, they stop working at 8PM. So, it's no biggie for us. We had a great time and enjoyed our stay so much. You can see more pics and review on my fb page Travellifeinthailand :) Show more Samuch February 2019 Quiet and good facilities. A few mins walk from the room to the beach (through property walk way). Not close to public transport, recommend own vehicle. Lei October 2018 The picture is see that the hotel near by the sea, but actually not, although hotel’s surrounding is different for the picture, the customer service is good.

105 ,Fantastic Apartment On The Beach! ,4.83 · ,64 reviews ,$80 ,Hua Hin, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Thailand ,Location, location, location - this is it! Definitely the best stretch of beach in Hua Hin. Only 10 minutes walk to the centre of Hua Hin town and ON the beach. Very quiet and private with natural green surroundings and gorgeous swimming pools for the ultimate relaxation.

Perfect for families and couples. The 100 sqm apartment has 2 lovely bedrooms plus a futon for any extras staying over! A bright and airy space with an open plan kitchen, dining and living room as well as a private balcony.


A well equipped kitchen with plenty of dishes, glassware and cutlery. There is a 4 plate hob, fridge/freezer, microwave, kettle, blender and even a toastie maker! Next to the kitchen is a small second balcony where there is a washing machine for you to use at your leisure.

Cable TV is installed, fantastic for the kids when they’re tired out from all that beach activity and great to catch up on some films or global news when you want a night in. There is a DVD player and a few children and adult DVDs. WiFi is not yet in the apartment but the front office at Baan San Ploen supply WiFi cards on a weekly or monthly basis for a very reasonable price.
The complex itself is situated in a fantastic location between the Marriott and Cape Nidhra Hotel. There are 4 pools, including the gorgeous infinity pool with sea views as well as the children’s pool with playground The beautiful gardens are kept in pristine condition by gardeners 7 days a week.

The compound prides itself on being very secure conscious and provides 24/7 security at the front of the building as well as at the beach access point. Baan San Ploen has a gym, children's playroom, 2 saunas, a business centre and secure underground parking.

It has private access to the gorgeous white sandy beach which is amazing for long walks or for the more enthusiastic runner! The beach has plenty of activities for everyone, horse rides, banana boat and dingy rides plus jet skis for the more adventurous! ,What this place offers

Heating ,Rebecca December 2021 Spacious condo with nice pool and great location on the beach. Richard February 2020 Other five star reviews have set it all before. The flat is in a great location with respect to access to beach and pool as well as to stores and shops in Hua Hin. The flat is spacious clean and has everything you can possibly want. The host was incredibly responsive to our questions. The flatade an incredible vacation even more incredible. We'll be back....or at least will try! Show more Seth November 2016 Seriously awesome place to stay. Right on the beach with beautiful pools. Our family had a great time. I would suggest to anyone. Karen August 2022 As per so many other reviews we have to agree the location,  pool and view onto the beach were perfect!  The security staff were all friendly and helpful, happy to get you a taxi and even gathered our things when it started to rain and we had gone for a walk.   The gardens were lush and kept immaculate. We were there in August and found we often had the pool to ourselves, never an issue to get a sunbed.  We had plenty of blue sky though and only a handful of downpours in 12 days.  The apartment itself is home from home with cupboard of games and books. Slightly dated but has everything you need, air con works well and fans provided. Great to have washing machine. There is wifi and works well in apt.  We didnt cook as too many places to eat out! With places to suit ALL budgets so close by so for us we we were out and by the pool more than in the apartment but the balcony was also pleasant to sit for a drink or game of cards too and airers provided for dying towels etc.  Check in  very smooth and Fiona always answered any questions promptly and very helpful with info.  She arranged a taxi from airport for us.   If it helps to know for your budgeting we paid around 1900 baht for 12 days water and elec.. We used aircon at night overnight and 4 of us for showers and wash machine but I would say we hardly used anything during the day.  Walkable from the beach you have a choice of higher end beach club and hotels to eat/ drink at and if you turn to the right 2 min walk there are paddle boards, jet skis etc and a nice rustic typical beach bar with lovely food and service very affordable.  the hilton has a happy hr 241 early evenings for rooftop bar if you want to go for a view.  Just one other tip as there  are far too many places you will find when there but some people that live in the apartments told us of a food market not so well know as hua hin night ... just opposite straight up the road from Venice hotel 5 mins walk is an inexpensive food market for all tastes with live music every day, locals and tourists here, more basic than the fish restaurants in hua hin market (which were all lovely) but still delicious street food, smoothies and beer.  Next to the venice hotel Is a massage place that was brilliant too.  There are 100s of massage places and sure they are all good but this one doesn't have people to get you in and looks expensive as no boards outside but is same prices as all the others, clean,  aircon and really good massages. £12.50 for 1.5 hrs and I was there nearer 2 hrs I think!   If we went back to Hua Hin we would definitely stay here again.  Thank you.   Show more Erwin August 2022 Great place to stay! Andie August 2022 This place has the best location in Hua Hin! Super central and the view from the pool on the beach is amazing!!

Heating ,Daniel September 2022 great host, great communication, great property. Alexia August 2022 Great location for the value, within walking distance to many bars, food, and the beach. Condo was not busy due to tourism still catching up in Pattaya, so catching the super-fast elevators were not a problem. Listing advertised rooftop pool but it was not available for use — unfortunately, a big reason why I booked this place. The 3rd floor pool was available in the sister building, as well as the gym, and both did not have much traffic so it was easy to use. Bed is very uncomfortable and the unit is small for two people, but you get what you pay for in terms of the location, some amenities, and price. I would stay again if the low price remained the same, but not if it went up. Show more Frank June 2022 room was awesome and location was great. the host was also super quick to answer if I had any questions. would recommend if you need a place for a month stay. Stephen February 2022 The place is infested with Cockroaches. They are in the living room, kitchen, inside the Fridge, toaster, in the bedroom and in the bathroom. I almost gazed myself with spray to kill them but I was unsuccessful. This issue was never fixed. Landlord know about the issue before I rented it and still when I left Cockroaches are still there. Show more Wendell January 2022 The apartment was very nice and upkeep was very good. I wouldn’t stay here again with Thanaboon. Sam October 2021 Nice unit and location.

Heating ,Ratchaneewan July 2022 Great location & well appointed apartment. Dan February 2020 The Base is a big complex in the middle of Pattaya, so if you want to be tourist, but slighly off the busy road, it's prefect. The room was clean, pools very nice, adequate gym and easy security. It was quiet...For the money, it's a good value. I recommend this place of Lilian's at the Base Condo. Show more Sean December 2019 Really a very clean place with a fantastic location. The pool is awesome, though sometimes busy. Daniel September 2018 The condo is nice and clean. My highlight was the roof top pool which has an amazing view over the city and ocean. I recoomend to stay here if u like to stay right in the centre of Pattaya.

Show more Heidi April 2022 Lilian is a great host. I messaged her at 9pm on a Sunday to ask if we could book her place for that same night (had problems with the place I had originally booked and needed to find something immediately) and she made her place available for us and always responded within minutes if we had any questions. The space itself is as the photos show. The view is onto the opposite building, which is far enough away to be open but not entirely private. Was a short walk to the beach and main beach road with lots of restaurants and a grocery store close by. We enjoyed using the pool, basketball court and gym. Show more Franck December 2021 The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting. Evgeni November 2021 The apartment is very nice and comfortable! Location is very convenient, near restaurants and shopping mall. Derick June 2020 Nice stay in Pattaya! Benjamin August 2019 Lillian's place is central to everything, it has a great view and the pool on the roof is great for photos with a view loved staying here and will stay again and again ,['Hosted_by_Lilian@b59b375a-4086-4cb0-b077-4d82e74d77a9', 'Hosted_by_Lilian@546c233a-8ade-4c2d-afa4-66aeb85c9439', 'Hosted_by_Lilian@c03cfe73-cfdc-4869-a8c5-7f8b21a5e8a2', 'Hosted_by_Lilian@3cdbd315-e736-4beb-8d06-9cb8dc7fbead', 'Hosted_by_Lilian@87e6a8c9-054d-4dce-a70d-70394567e70f']

La Casita is the embodiment of a new condominium at the heart of Hua Hin that truly stands out with Spanish-inspired architecture. The multidimensional design of colorful pastels is infused with overtones evocative of the island of Ibiza that lies to the east of Spain and brings to mind its atmosphere of white, sandy beaches gently lapped by crystal clear waters and vivacious parties thronged with the world’s leading celebrities.

The room is 27 sq.m, consisting of studio room with a double bed, a sitting room with a sofa bed, an air conditioner and free Wifi. A bathroom with hot water shower, and a functional kitchenette with a full-size refrigerator, electric stove, microwave and an electric kettle. There's also a full set of dining and kitchen utensils if you fancy cooking yourself, though we would highly recommend dining out at one of the many restaurants nearby.

Heating ,Sebastian August 2022 Great host . Nice apartment. Perfect location. answer you back fast . easy check inn Luke March 2020 We had a fantastic stay. The place is close to everything, walking distance to Avenue shopping centre, cinemas, and restaurants. The pool is fantastic! Having Netflix available on both smart TVs was awesome! 순두 August 2022 The owner here is really nice person. 露 January 2020 1 The location of the house and the facilities of the room and the neighborhood are okay. 2 I stayed for a total of 3 days, and the wifi was very inconvenient the next day. 3 The bathroom in the bedroom is fully transparent, although it is a friend's trip, it is still very inconvenient. 4 The shower water is small and the circulation is unstable. 5 There are no trash cans and garbage bags in the living room, so you need to bring your own. 6 The air conditioner is super noisy, and I was woken up at night. 7 The neighborhood is still quite close to the sea, and there is a 7-Eleven room with kitchen settings at the door.

**Random room arrangement **
I have many rooms in this apartment, one bedroom & two bedroom Different floors, different rooms, different view, so the price is not the same. Please tell me which floor or type of room you want. The picture shows only one of the rooms
~~
1) Two persons sleep inside the bedroom on the queen sized bed.
2) 3rd person sleeps on the sofa
3) 4th person sleeps on the foldable floor mattress.

My condominium is economically and reasonably charged for just 2 persons. I do not charge extra for the 3rd and 4th persons to stay in my apartment. I even provide extra pillows and blankets for the 3rd and 4th persons. Basically, 3 - 4 persons stay for the price of 2 persons. Towels for the 3rd and 4th persons are chargeable at 50 baht per piece. I appreciate your understanding.

The condominium is about 30 square meters in size. It has 1 bedroom with 1 queen sized bed, 1 living room, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen and 1 balcony.

So, please be understandable if 4 of you find the condominium is a bit too tight. Sometimes it's fun to be so close together.

Thanks.

Heating ,Lee June 2022 Really great condo in a central location. I would highly recommend staying here. The hosts were the best, very helpful. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 5 being best I’d give them a 6! Scott May 2022 ... I had great stay at Casper and Seven's condo. It is nicely decorated in a fun way with some cartoon (maybe anime) characters that children would enjoy. I liked it. Sheets had them too. It's a newish and extremely clean condo that seems a little larger than other Airbnb's I've stayed at here in Thailand. One of the things i really liked is that it's in a corner of the building and has a side window which can give it some cross ventilation. This has always been huge for me as I like to ventilate with fresh air daily. The kitchen is well equipped with pots, pans, dishes, toaster, coffee maker etc with stove burners and a microwave where I did daily cooking. Everything seemed new to include the refrigerator. I slept very comfortably here; I think the bed might be an orthopedic type because the back pain I was having when I came stopped within a few days. The washer on the balcony worked well and I was able to do a daily load. Big TV with Netflix did it's job. What else... Casper and Seven were extremely responsive to messages and always got back to me immediately after I messaged them. The location couldn't be more perfect being in the center of town close to the shopping, dining, and entertainment areas of Hua Hin. This building has a very beautiful pool by the way. Fitness room looks nice as well You know something else about the building, the staff here is amazing. Management, security, housekeeping and maintenance are the most friendly and polite people in the world. They treated me like I was an owner rather than just a temporary guest. I extended my stay twice and stayed over a month. I would stay here again for sure. Show more Irena April 2022 Top location; comfortable apartament; perfect communication with Hosts. They left for us welcome drinks and tasty coffee capsules - thank You guys! Huge plasma TV with every app like Apple TV etc. Washing machine on balcony. Everything is new and clean, so you can feel like in your own new home. There is a swimming pool also - I thought (from web pictures) that it can be small- but it is the longest swimming pool we got in our 4 months trip - perfect for swimming, but also for just relaxing - nice garden around. Highly recommended - no better place in Hua Hin, trust me!!! Show more Tommi April 2022 Excellent place on excellent location. Everything worked good 😊 Kanitsorn January 2022 Hi Yunlin, It's nice staying at your accommodation. The place is very very clean, comfortable and convenient. The bed is nice and comfy. It allows me to sleep well at night which is not quite usual when we travel and stay over night at new places. It's changed our mindset about staying in Airbnb places. The place is close to Hua Hin beach, 5-10 minute walk. The swimming pool is clean, beautiful and private. The staff is nice and can speak English fluently. My kids and I love the place a lot and we definitely visit your place again if we have a chance to come to Hua Hin. Keep up the good work.

Sheldon March 2022 This was my first BNB experience and I was not disappointed the location of this property is in the perfect location in Pattaya, walking distance to many amenities like a 24 hour gym and 2nd road. The unit a perfect size, with a large bathroom.

Nice place with lots of space and fully equipped kitchen and good facilities, feels like home really. The rooms and the living area are cleaned. The widely balcony is very spectacular view. The swimming pool and private beach are the highlights. The clean beach and private. The host is very helpful and provides quick response if you have any enquiries. The location is good, lots of good restaurants and local food places nearby, as well as 7-11 ;-)  Overall a very pleasant stay, relaxing, peaceful and private Show more Matthawan April 2021 Excellent place to stay.

We really enjoyed the view from the balcony, the large pool, and the proximity to the beach. Quiet area so it is good to have your own transportation.

Show more Aleksandr January 2020 Very spacious place, amazing view and location if you want peace and quiet. Apartment itself is showing its age a bit but remains very good value for money. Fully equipped kitchen, feels like home really. Condo itself has very nice grounds and huge pool, furnishings a bit dated but in overall good condition. Right on a very nice beach that allows you walking for hours. All communications with Hong - very prompt and polite, she’s very nice host. One thing to be aware - the place itself is more or less in the muddle of nowhere, but for us it’s more of a bonus, we hate crowds , and it’s no problem to drive a little bit.
